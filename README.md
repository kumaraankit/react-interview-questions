1. What is react.

    React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called      “components”.
    
2. What do you mean by declarative in react.
    React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right             components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
    
3. What is the difference between imperative and declarative.
    The word "imperative" here implies "commanding" the computer to do something. We have to directly tell the browser exactly how to do every little thing we need it to do. This     is "the old way", and it's what you do with vanilla JavaScript or something like jQuery.
